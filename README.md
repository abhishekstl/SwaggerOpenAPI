# SwaggerOpenAPI
This project is an example to develop swagger documentation with Open API, instead of spring fox

lately i was facing issues in developing Swagger documentation with Spring Fox which was having some compatibility issues with Spring 3.0 onwards,
Hope this project helps people who are looking alternatives to Spring Fox Dependency
